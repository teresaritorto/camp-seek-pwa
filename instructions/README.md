# Introduction

Welcome! By now you have learned about Agile, product management, UX and design, and development. In this session we'll build on all those things you learned and deliver your finished application to the internet. What's the use of writing all that awesome code if no-one gets to see it?

By the end of this session, you should have the tools to take any app and make it available so that anyone around the world, on any device can view it. We hope you'll be able to use the knowledge from today to help you get your Create-a-thon app live.

We are Teresa and Darko, and this is **Signed, sealed, delivered**.

## Overview

This is a seven step session, which you can run at either your own pace or along with us. Don't worry if you don't finish everything - you can always come back later. 

We'll give you time for each section if you're following along with us and be floating around helping you with any questions you may have in the meantime.

The steps are:

1. Introduction - you are here
1. Setup - here we'll set up any tools and accounts you don't already have
1. Converting to PWA - first steps to conversion to a progressive web app
1. Architecture - thinking about how to structure your application code
1. Responsify - making you app look great on screens of all sizes
1. Security and QA - securing and testing each others apps 
1. Service workers - an advanced bonus step
1. Conclusion - wrap up!

## Progressive web apps

You'll hear the acronym PWA lots today. It stands for Progressive Web App, which means a website that can function like a normal website, but one that can also pretend like an app on your phone when you add it to your home screen.

PWA's are a way to write code only once and have it work on many different devices - which is great because it lets devs concentrate on fun things like awesome features instead of writing lots of different versions of our apps.
