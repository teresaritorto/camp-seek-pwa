#Deployment and QA

Now that we've made our app responsive, we need to re-upload our files to dropbox.

##Steps

1. Copy your files over to your dropbox apps/pancake.io folder to have them sync to the Pancake host.
2. Note this time we will be visiting our site using the HTTPS address, so go ahead and remove your app that you had saved to your home screen and re-add it using the same web address, but using https:// instead of http://
3. Once added to the home screen, visit your app by clicking on it.
3. You should see all of the responsive changes.

##Bonus Step
Try downloading the apps from other people around you test them out (don't forget the https://).
